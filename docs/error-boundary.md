# Error Boundary Implementation

This implementation provides a robust error handling system for the Hathi app using React Error Boundaries and React-Toastify for better toast notifications.

## Components

### 1. Toast System (`components/ui/toast.tsx`)

-   Built on top of **react-toastify** for professional-grade notifications
-   Supports different toast types: error, success, warning, info
-   Auto-dismissing toasts with customizable duration
-   Positioned at **top-right** of the screen as requested
-   Includes smooth animations and progress bars
-   Consistent styling with app's design system

### 2. Error Boundary (`components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`)

-   React Error Boundary that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree
-   Automatically displays error toasts when errors occur
-   Provides fallback UI for catastrophic errors
-   Includes a "Try Again" button to reset the error state

### 3. Integration with Chat System

-   Monitors chat hook status for errors
-   Displays toast notifications when chat errors occur
-   Agent errors are automatically shown as red toasts in top-right corner

## Usage

The error boundary and toast system are integrated at the `NotesPanel` level:

```tsx
<ToastProvider>
    <ErrorBoundary>{/* Your app components */}</ErrorBoundary>
</ToastProvider>
```

### Displaying Custom Toasts

#### Using the useToast hook (backward compatible):

```tsx
const { addToast } = useToast();

// Error toast
addToast({
    type: "error",
    message: "Something went wrong!",
    duration: 8000,
});

// Success toast
addToast({
    type: "success",
    message: "Operation completed successfully!",
});
```

#### Using the direct toast API (recommended):

```tsx
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/toast";

// Error toast
toast.error("Something went wrong!");

// Success toast
toast.success("Operation completed successfully!");

// With custom options
toast.warning("Custom warning", {
    autoClose: 10000,
    position: "top-center"
```

### Current Integration

-   **Chat Errors**: Automatically displayed when `chatHook.status === "error"`
-   **JavaScript Errors**: Caught by Error Boundary and displayed as toasts
-   **Agent Errors**: Integrated with the chat system to show agent-specific errors

## Testing

You can test the error boundary by:

1. Triggering a chat error (when API fails)
2. Using the test utilities in `lib/error-test-utils.ts`
3. Using the ToastTestComponent in `components/ui/toast-test.tsx` (development only)
4. Throwing errors in development mode

## Features

### React-Toastify Benefits:

-   Professional animations and transitions
-   Built-in accessibility features
-   Progress bars for auto-dismiss
-   Pause on hover functionality
-   Drag to dismiss
-   Queue management for multiple toasts
-   Better mobile responsiveness

### Styling

The toasts use react-toastify with custom CSS overrides in `app/globals.css`:

-   Error toasts: Red background with white text
-   Success toasts: Green background with white text
-   Warning toasts: Yellow background with white text
-   Info toasts: Blue background with white text

Features include:

-   **Position**: Top-right corner as requested
-   **Font**: Uses Outfit font family for consistency
-   **Animations**: Smooth slide-in/out animations
-   **Progress bars**: Visual countdown for auto-dismiss
-   **Icons**: Built-in type-appropriate icons
-   **Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop

## Dependencies

-   `react-toastify@11.0.5` - Core toast notification library
-   Custom CSS overrides in `app/globals.css`
